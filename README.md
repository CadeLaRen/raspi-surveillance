# raspi-surveillance
A website running on a Raspberry Pi for viewing and managing livestreams from Raspberry Pi cameras in the local network.

*Attention: This is a practice project and is in no way intended or suitable to be used for serious surceillance use cases.*

## TODO
- Tell that no login/ API auth is used (important)
- Extend to match to other repos
